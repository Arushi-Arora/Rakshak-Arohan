#### Problem Statement
"A technical solution is required to create digital crime maps that can be generated real time and get populated after every incident. The software can feed in GIS information of the place of occurrence along with other details and plot it on a map. A click on those points should give all details related to that particular crime in form of a pop up. This would greatly help in predictive analysis and enhance police capabilities for providing a safe and secure environment for the people."
